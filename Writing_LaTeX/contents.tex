	Everyone agrees that this issue is really important. But we do not
	know much about this specific question, although it matters a great
	deal, for these reasons. We approach the problem from this
	perspective. Our research design focuses on these cases and relies
	on these data, which we analyze using this method. Results show what
	we have learned about the question. They have these broader
	implications.
